Business Network Definition created in Composer Playground, contains the bna too this time

Will keep it updated.
If you make any changes rewrite the .bna zip by running the following command in the medrex-business-network directory

//the dot means make an archive of this dir. By default it places it in same directory too


$ composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName .
